    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build a NLP classification model that can accurately classify a users tweets as \"Negative\", \"Positive\" or \"Neutral\". Having an effective model is important since it will be tracking the textual behavior in real time to predict if the context of a tweet is positive or not. With the use of this predictive model, companies can be learn about newly deployed features reactions in order to determaine better business strategies.\n",

    "* Obtain: The dataset consists of 9,000 user tweets and was downloaded from the Data.world Datasets Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scrub: I will search for null values and outliers to replace them with more suitable values or delete them form the data set. I will also look at multicollinearity issues amongst the features and find creative ways to deal with them.\n",

    "* Explore: Throughout the whole process, it is important to lookout for other important information that can be gathered from the data. I will carry out Exploratory Data Analysis and answer relevant questions about the current state of business.\n",

If we do not do this, the model will try and predict a Neutral label as it is 60% guaranteed due to the imbalance."
